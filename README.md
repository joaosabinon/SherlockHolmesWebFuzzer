# Sherlock Holmes Web Fuzzer


**What is this?**
Sherlock Holmes is a web fuzzer focused on finding files hidden on web servers. The main inspiration for creating this software was the methodology suggested by OWASP (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Review_Old,_Backup_and_Unreferenced_Files_for_Sensitive_Information_(OTG-CONFIG-004)) and in their own daily needs. A good recognition of the target completely changes the result of a pentest.

**How to use**
